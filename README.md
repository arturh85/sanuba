# 砂場 Sunaba

A 2D falling-sand physics sandbox survival game, inspired by Noita and Terraria.

## Features (Planned)

- **Emergent Physics**: Every pixel is simulated with material properties
- **Chemistry System**: Materials react with each other (fire spreads, water evaporates, acid dissolves)
- **Persistent World**: Changes persist across sessions
- **Survival Gameplay**: Crafting, building, exploration

## Building

```bash
# Debug build
cargo run

# Release build (faster simulation)
cargo run --release
```

## Development Status

🚧 **Early Development** - Core simulation and rendering being implemented.
